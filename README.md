# Circular Queue Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Circular Queue** is a type of queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position, forming a circle.  
This allows better memory utilization than a simple linear queue.  

Common real-life examples:  
- CPU scheduling.  
- Traffic light systems.  
- Buffer management in streaming data.
